To summarize the C++ project and describe what it solves, we go to the assignment information on CS 210 Module 3 Project Guidelines
A program that analyzes text records that are generated throughout a day. The store needs to know how often the items are 
purchased so that the store can create the most effective layout for the customers. To do this, a menu if created with three
options - 1. Display number of items purchased by name, 2. Display all items purchased, 3. Display histogram of all items
purchased, and 4. exit program. Additionally, when the program exits it creates a backup .dat file listing all the items
purchased. The .dat file can easily be read using a text editor such as notepad.

What I did well was use maps (aka dictionaries in Python) to hold a list of all the frequencies and vectors to hold a list
of all the item names, in addition to describing nearly every line of code with comments. Also, the program uses a class
to organize all of the functions and variables so it's like a black box and all main has to do is instantiate the object
and make a few function calls.

To enhance my code I could add more menu options with even more functionality, or perhaps make a GUI instead of a
text-based program. Ah, but of course I could've used a switch structure instead of many if statements.

The most challenging part of writing the code... not at all, the development of the program was a smooth and easy process.
Even the bug fixing was no trouble at all. Unfortunately not all coding will be like this.

What tools and resources am I adding to my support network? I do not fully understand this question at the time.
I know that having friends of virtue can act as a support network but nobody ever talked to me about a github
support network before. Do you mean what projects I will add in the future? In that case, I do not know just yet.
I will continue experimenting with code and if I make something cool such as a solution to a challenge problem on 
AdventOfCode, I'll share it.

What skills from this project will help with the future? Ah, but of course classes and vectors; I was very fuzzy about
these concepts previously and would like to practice them more. That, and I'll be sure to make many comments in all of
my projects.

The program is definitely maintainable, readable, and adaptable; it's full of comments on the code, uses classes
broken into .cpp and .h files, and is concluded in as few lines of code as possible.

Thank you.
